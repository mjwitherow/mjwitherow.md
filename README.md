G'day :wave: 

You’re here because chances are, we work together now! 🎉 

Disclaimer :warning:
People are an ever changing complex mashup of flaws, biases and preferences.  
A README for a human is kinda borked from the outset, my aim is only for lo-fi info.  

This is an addition to, not a substitute for, us having a chat together. :coffee:

I'm not a line manager, but in some form my role has leadership expectations.
I believe effective leaders must be knowable.
This README is just an opportunity I have to make myself more knowable to you, and I welcome many more.

#### My Role

As a Software Architect, I will be in service to you
* To provide clarity. 
* To build context.  
* To give direction.  
* To advise on technical decisions, costs and strategies.  
* To deliver working software, and world class products.  
* To grow talent (that’s you).  

I don't tell The Business what to do, but I do explain the cost of our options.

#### My Principles

* I want to maximise the amount of Work Not Done. 
    * This means staying focused on the work that matters
    * This is because I hate Busy Work, being busy != being productive
* Complexity is the primary force that undoes us as Software Practioners, and I intend to remove it.
* We are all learning over time. A sound Software Architecture should welcome change and limit the cost of reversions or corrections for delivery teams as we learn.

#### Contacting Me

I like Slack.
I’m most responsive on Slack and I don’t mind a big novel being dumped into a DM.
If it’s important, needs a face-to-face conclusion or is for a date some time away - best email me that content and book my calendar at the same time.
If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating I will always tend towards "let's chat face to face” - that’s my preference.

#### My Day

I'm strong in the morning, but vulnerable to 3:30'itus.
I’m always interruptible at my desk, please come over.
I relish the opportunity to change scenery, so if you just need a chat - I’m up for a walk.
I might have a lot of Things on the go, but few of them are more important than talking with you if you want to talk with me.

#### 1-1’s

If you would like a regular catchup, I'll suggest we start a ritual (rather than Adhoc).  
> Every second Tuesday, Inside Coffee with Matt @ 9:00 am

I generally encourage shorter, more frequent catchups. 

When we have a 1-on-1, they are for you.
Without an agenda I might ask you "What sucks?" - this often unpacks what you feel is succeeding, what isn't, and how I can help.
I prefer to do a 1-on-1 in person, so if you need to work from home please let me know so we can reschedule.

#### Feedback

I make mistakes, sometimes at great speed and volume!
It’s because I want to improve, which is why I highly value your feedback. 
I understand giving feedback can be difficult. I’m happy for you to give feedback in whatever form makes you comfortable (even anonymously via my manager), however I prefer in-person feedback, because it allows me to get context and confirm I take away the right stuff.

#### Growth and Mentorship

I've benefited enourmously from strong mentor relationships in my career, and I feel compelled to pass it on.
I want to leave this industry in a better state than how i found it, and so far building a mentorship culture has been the most effective.

I have a particular passion for education
- I’ve worked with primary schools & secondary schools to run STEM workshops, weekend programmes and speaking events.
- I’ve been a Course Leader & Lecturer at Australian Universities.
- I’ve presented internationally beside Google, Facebook and Dropbox on the topic of Mentoring.
- I’ve been a mentor in the industry to many wonderful people, most of them women. From 20-something graduates to mature age career changers.

I'm always looking to add to this list, let me know if i can help you.

#### My Values

- I’m comfortable with candour and transparency, but I appreciate not every one is.
- I have opinions, this does not mean they are correct. Please challenge my opinions so that I can learn with you.
- I always start with an assumption of positive intent, I believe people try to do the right thing with the information they had at the time.
- My role may at times require me to withhold information but it never requires me to lie.

#### My Quirks

- I have (amoung many others) a bias to execute. DO IT, DO IT NOW!
- I enjoy clearly stated or decided language. An honest attempt at clarity in my own writing has been felt as 'cold' before, I'm working on that.
- Please don't confuse my quiet mid-distance staring with a lack of engagement, I'm just thinking.
- I'm a 'Late Game' player. It takes me a little longer to get my momentum.
- I have a poor memory. You might notice I’m always carrying a notebook. I like to take lots of notes, it helps me remember. 
    - Please don’t be concerned if I’m scribbling madly when we talk, I’m listening very carefully.
- I often greet people with a fist bump. I started doing it factiously ten years ago and now I can’t stop.
